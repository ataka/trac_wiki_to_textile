h1. Trac Wiki to GitHub

This is a *very* rough start of a script to help convert Trac wiki syntax to GitHub friendly syntax.

To use:
# Copy your @trac.db@ file into the same directory as the @convert.rb@ script.
# Create a @wiki@ directory to hold the output files.
# @./convert.rb@

Open each file, copy and paste into GitHub.

h2. Caveats

You still need to look over the markup and fix any mistakes. It isn't perfect by any means, but it will save some time.

h2. To Do

Beg GitHub to work on their API so this could be more automated.
